\project_{pizza} (
    ((\select_{gender="female" and age>20} Person )
    \join Eats))


# 2
Close:   got the pizza names not the women's names

\project_{pizza}(
(\select_{pizzeria='Straw Hat'} Serves)  
\join
(\project_{name}
\select_{gender='female'} Person)
\join Eats)

retry ?
got both the name and the pizza, not just the name
(\project_{name} (
\select_{gender='female'} Person)
\join
\project_{pizza}
(\select_{pizzeria='Straw Hat'} Serves) 
\join Eats)


#3
Got incorrect, but will need to revisit/post a message since, from the data  I have seen, Amy nor Fay have eaten at Little New York Pizza.
this had syntax error
\project_{pizzeria} (
(\select_{name='Amy' or name='Fay'} Frequents )
\join {price < 10} Serves)

used this:
\project_{pizzeria}
(
(\select_{name='Amy' or name='Fay'} Frequents )
\join
 (\select_{price <10} Serves)
)

#4 
got an empty set

\project_{pizzeria}
(
(\select_{name='Amy' and name='Fay'} Frequents )
\join
 (\select_{price <10} Serves)
)
