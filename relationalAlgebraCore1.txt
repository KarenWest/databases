Question #1:
Find all pizzas eaten by at least one female over the age of 20.

\project_{pizza} (
    ((\select_{gender="female" and age>20} Person )
    \join Eats))                 

Question #2:

Find the names of all females who eat at least one pizza served by Straw
Hat. (Note: The pizza need not be eaten at Straw Hat.)

\project_{name}(
  ((\select_{pizzeria="Straw Hat"} Serves) //all pizzas Straw Hat serves
   \join
   Eats //all people who eat the pizzas that Straw Hat serves
   \join
   (\select_{gender="female"} Person) //all females who eat straw hat pizzas
   ))

Question #3:
Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that 
either Amy or Fay (or both) eat.

\project_{pizzeria}(
  ((\select_{price < 10.0} Serves) //all pizzas less than $10
  \join
  (\select_{(name = 'Amy') or (name = 'Fay')} Eats) //all pizzas Fay and-or Amy
  eat
  ))

Question #4:
Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that both
Amy and Fay eat.

\project_{pizzeria}(
  ((\select_{price < 10.0} Serves) //all pizzas less than $10
  \join
  (Eats //all people who eat pizzas less than $10
  \diff
  (\select_{(name != 'Amy') and (name != 'Fay')} Eats)) //all pizzas Fay and Amy do NOT eat
  \join
  Frequents //the pizzeria's that Amy and Fay frequent
  ))

Question #5: my incorrect solution -- column number matching issue?:
Find the names of all people who eat at least one pizza served by Dominos but
who do not frequent Dominos.
\project_{name}(
  ((\select_{pizzeria = 'Dominos'} Serves) //pizzas served by Dominos
   \join
   Eats // names of people who eat these types of Dominos pizzas
  //cols = pizza, price, name
  \join 
  Frequents // cols now name only of people who eat Dominos pizza types
  \diff 
  (\select_{pizzeria = 'Dominos'} Frequents) //minus people names who frequent Dominos
  ))  

Pam's correct solution:
\project_{name} ( //selects name column - the project rel.op. from:     
    ( \project_{name} ( 
      //selects name column again from: Person - people names who frequent at Dominos pizza
        ((\project_{name} Person) //all names from Person table
            \diff   // minus
            // people names who frequest at Dominos - subracted from above
            (\project_{name}  \select_{pizzeria='Dominos'} Frequents)
            ))) //end of selecting name col from this difference
    \intersect // overlaps with:
    (\project_{name} //select col name from: 
        (Eats  // Eats table cols (names and pizza type) joined with:
        \join
        (\project_{pizza} 
           //select col pizza from Serves table for pizza types from Dominos 
           ( \select_{pizzeria='Dominos'} Serves)   )))
)
